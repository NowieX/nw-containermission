# nw-containermission
nw-containermission is a custom FiveM script designed for roleplay servers. It introduces a unique container mission where players can interact with an NPC, receive a mission, and experience immersive synchronized animations while breaking open a stranded container filled with cash.

The mission allows players to engage in dynamic roleplay, as they locate and crack open the container, with a trolley of money inside. The script features a cinematic camera shift to a first-person view (POV) as the player grabs the money, enhancing the realism of the interaction.
